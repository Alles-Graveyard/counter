        <h1>Counter, by Alles.</h1>
        <p>
            Counter is a service by Alles that allows you to use one line of code to get very simple analytics.
            It's just an image, with a unique id that you can make whatever you want. No API keys, no registration, just an img tag.
        </p>
        <code><i>&lt;</i><i>img</i> <i>src</i><i>=</i><i>"https://counter.alles.cx/[id]"</i> <i>/&gt;</i></code>
        <p>
            You could use it on your website, in an email, or in a discord channel.
            If you wanted, you could hide the image on your site.
            Counter is simple, privacy-friendly and versatile.

        <h2>FAQ</h2>

        <h3>What data does Counter collect?</h3>
        <p>
            The only data counter collects is the user's IP address, which we only store temporarily for ratelimiting.
            Counter aims to store as little data as possible, so it's very privacy-friendly.
            You don't even have to sign in to use it.
        </p>

        <h3>How long will you store the visitor count?</h3>
        <p>
            Currently, the visitor count for all sites is reset after 10,000 visitors are stored.
            We store the visitors in memory, so if the server restarts, data is wiped.
            If Counter recieves a lot of use, we'll use a database and make the count persist indefinately.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I use the same Counter across sites?</h3>
        <p>
            Sure! There are no restrictions on where the counter can be placed, and you can simply use the same code for multiple counter images.
            We have CORS enabled on the image endpoint.
        </p>
        
        <h3>How can I reset my site's counter?</h3>
        <p>
            Simply use a different id.
            If you are recieving spam requests, unfortunately, there isn't much we can do for now, because there is no site verification.
        </p>

        <h3>How long will this service exist/be free?</h3>
        <p>
            We plan to keep this service online as long as we can, and it will be free forever.
            It's a useful tool that we think everybody should be able to use.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I host this myself?</h3>
        <p>
            Sure! It's all <a href="https://github.com/alleshq/counter-image">open-source on GitHub</a>, so you can download and host it yourself, or even propose some changes.
        </p>

        <h3>How can I support the project?</h3>
        <p>
            While this doesn't cost too much to run, I'd appreciate it if you were to donate.
            It would help me not only keep this service online, but also fund <a href="https://abaer.dev">my other projects</a>.
            You can donate to me on <a href="https://patreon.com/archiebaer">Patreon</a>.
